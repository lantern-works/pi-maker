# pi-maker

### Getting Started

```bash
make && make image
```

A new disk image for Raspberry Pi will appear inside this project folder within "share/build". This solution has been tested with Raspberry Pi Zero W and may work for other models, too.

### Next: Flash With Desktop App

[Download Etcher](http://etcher.io)

Open the desktop application and follow the prompts to select the disk image and the desired SD Card to use.

### Or: Flash With Command Line

[Install Etcher CLI](https://etcher.io/cli/)

Run the commands below and the terminal will prompt you to select the desired drive to install to. Please be careful to select the proper SD Card and not another disk to avoid unwanted data loss.

```bash
make && make image
sudo etcher ./share/build/rpi.img
```

### Requirements

A local [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition) environment is required in order to build an image.

### Customization

The docker entrypoint mainly does two things:

  1. copies all files from `share/copy-this` to the root filesystem
  2. runs `share/setup` (as root)
    * ...which runs `share/my-scripts/test-script` by default

The easiest way to customize the image build process, is to put scripts in `share/my-scripts`,
and edit `share/setup` to run whatever scripts you want. Remember the scripts will run as root
so if you want to do something as the pi user, prefix it with `sudo -u pi dothething`.

#### Customizing the base OS

By exporting `OS_IMAGE`, and/or `OS_URI` you can use a different operating system, like so:

```bash
# Creating a raspbian image requires merging the boot partition into the root tar
pushd share/build
export LATEST_BUILD='2018-11-15-21:03'
wget http://vx2-downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite/archive/${LATEST_BUILD}/boot.tar.xz
wget http://vx2-downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite/archive/${LATEST_BUILD}/root.tar.xz
unxz root.tar.xz
mkdir -p boot && tar -xf boot.tar.xz -C boot && sudo chown -R 0 boot && sudo chgrp -R 0 boot
tar -rf root.tar boot && sudo rm -rf boot
export IMAGE_SIZE=4G
export OS_IMAGE=root.tar
popd
make image
```
